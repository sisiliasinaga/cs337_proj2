The code for this project is written in Python 3.7. The dependencies it uses are the natural language toolkit (nltk),
requests for retrieving information from a given URL, and BeautifulSoup for webscraping.

To run the code, launch parser.py. The terminal should open and prompt for a recipe URL from AllRecipes. The terminal will then print out
this recipe and prompt the user to apply a transformation to this recipe. The user can apply as many transforms as they
choose to in any order until the user chooses to enter a different AllRecipes URL or terminate the program.
